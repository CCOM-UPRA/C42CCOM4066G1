# Additional Information

###  Removed Stackable Short Flag
The stackable short flag was removed because in c++ (using our current library) it caused compatibility issues with the SAM short flag, given they were both -s.

### Variable Name Changes
Not implemented for now, some variable names currently have typos (such as 'treshold'), and they dont seem to follow a standard...

### Running command (for test cases)
```
g++ -std=c++17  "Aidan G. Varela Soto/precision_recall.cpp" -o precision_recall 
./precision_recall -g genome.fa -f probes.fasta -s sam_dir -c meta_dir -l 1000
```
